# Zero

Zero is a general-purpose programming language designed to be fast, simple, and universal. It can be used to build almost anything — from automations and apps to games and logic systems.

This language avoids unnecessary complexity and uses readable, friendly syntax made for both beginners and power users.

> Run with: zero file.zs

## Overview

Zero is not a clone of Python or JavaScript. It’s a standalone language with:

- Clean syntax (no cryptic symbols)
- Instant execution using its own interpreter
- A custom command-line tool: zero
- Human-like functions such as screen.print("Hello!")

It’s made to get out of your way and let you build — fast.

## Example Code
```
name = "Albert"
screen.print("Hello, " + name)

if time.now() > 12:
    screen.print("Good afternoon")
else:
    screen.print("Good morning")
```

---

## Features in v0.1

- Variable creation using let
- String and math operations
- if, else, and logic blocks
- while and repeat loops
- screen.print() for readable output
- More built-in functions coming soon

## How to Run

You’ll be able to run Zero like this:

```
    zero file.zs
```

This will use the native ZeroScript CLI tool.
